  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Last updated: August 1, 2025</p>

  <p>“Can I Eat This?” (“we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy. This Policy explains what we process, why, and your choices. By using the app, you agree to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>1) No Personal Account or Profile</h2>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> create user accounts or collect personal identifiers like name, email, phone number, or precise location.</p>

  <h2>2) Scans & AI Processing</h2>
  <p>Barcode scans and ingredient text are processed primarily <strong>on-device</strong>. For nutrition analysis, we may send <strong>ingredient text only</strong> (no images) to AI services to generate answers. Please <strong>do not</strong> include personal, health, or sensitive information in free-text inputs.</p>
  <p>We use OpenAI APIs for AI responses. OpenAI may retain prompts/responses for service improvement. See <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>3) Product Lookups & Third-Party Data</h2>
  <p>To fetch product information we call the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data" target="_blank">OpenFoodFacts API</a>. That service may log request metadata (e.g., IP address) under its own policy.</p>

  <h2>4) Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Purchases and subscriptions are processed by your app store. We do not receive your full payment details. We use RevenueCat to validate receipts and manage entitlements. These services may process device/platform identifiers, purchase receipts, country/region, and related metadata to complete transactions and prevent fraud.</p>
  <p>Learn more: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">RevenueCat Privacy</a> · <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy</a></p>

  <h2>5) What We Don’t Do</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> run ads, behavioral tracking, third-party analytics, or crash reporters. We do not sell your data. We do not store scan images or your history on our servers.</p>

  <h2>6) Minimal Technical Data</h2>
  <p>The app and its providers may receive limited technical data (e.g., device model, OS version, locale, app version, and IP-based region) necessary for delivering the service, debugging serious issues, processing purchases, and preventing abuse.</p>

  <h2>7) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We don’t keep your scans or results on our servers. Third-party providers (e.g., app stores, RevenueCat, OpenAI) retain data under their own policies and legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>8) Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t enter personal or sensitive information into free-text prompts.</li>
    <li>You can uninstall the app to remove data stored on your device.</li>
    <li>For purchases, manage/cancel via your app store.</li>
    <li>You can contact us to ask about this Policy or our providers’ roles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data we process. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>10) International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Our providers may process data on servers located in other countries. By using the app, you consent to such transfers subject to applicable legal protections.</p>

  <h2>11) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region). If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy. The “Last updated” date will change, and continued use means you accept the updated Policy.</p>
